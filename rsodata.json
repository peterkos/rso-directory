In association with the national organization, Active Minds, we strive to promote mental health awareness and education through campaigns, fundraising, informational meetings, and community-wide events. Examples of such campaigns and events include: Stress Less Week, Suicide Prevention Month, National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, etc.. Mental health disorders are an ever-growing problem in college. Unfortunately, most students suffer silently for fear of what others may think, or they simply don�t know where to start in getting help. It can be horribly isolating. Our goal is to provide a place where students can learn about mental health, and mental health issues. We hope to provide information about resources both on and off campus in order to promote help-seeking behaviors in individuals who may be able to benefit from them. We also work to relay the latest scholarly findings of mental health research and information as it pertains to college students. Mental health affects everyone in one way or another, which is why we need to bring Active Mind to UW. All students are welcome and encouraged to join. Please be sure to keep in mind that this is NOT a support group, and we do not provide any mental health counseling of any kind. We are not mental health professionals, but rather students interested in spreading mental health information and awareness, in order to stand up against the stigma surrounding mental health problems, and to promote a mentally healthy campus. Students with or without mental health issues are equally encouraged to join.",

Together, we can bring that number to zero.\n\nBeyond the Bomb is a bold new step towards a world free of the nuclear system�s yoke. Through grassroots organizing all over the U.S., we will build a wave of opposition to nuclear weapons and the networks of money and power that prop them up. Our movement will move from the local level to the state level to the federal level, building a base of engaged activists and supporters to change the conversation around nuclear weapons in this country. We are embracing the intersectionality of our issue, basing our organization on the knowledge that it�s the most marginalized of communities that are affected most by the nuclear system. Basing our organizing and actions around the voices of those communities and lifting up their stories, we will reveal the true fruits of the corrupt nuclear status quo.",

We are engaged in providing effective outreach to students about the benefits of smart solar investments.\n\nUW-Solar has two objectives:\n\n1. To provide clean and sustainable power production in order to reduce reliance on outside energy resources, improve the resilience of power systems to outages and reduce the overall  carbon footprint of the university. Allowing the university to become more self-sufficient in its energy production will reduce direct costs and environmental impact while improving capabilities for community service and rapid recovery during any future crises. The use of clean and renewable energy sources are a primary objective, as stated in the University of \n\nWashington Climate Action plan, for the future sustainability of the University.\n\n2. Smart infrastructure systems rely upon computerized systems (SCADA) for monitoring and remote control. SCADA systems control water and sewer infrastructure, electrical grids, oil refineries, transportation systems, manufacturing systems, nuclear energy and hazardous chemical production. Historically, such systems were developed in isolation from each other, and were not designed for security and resilience to cyber-attack. The security of these systems on campus is important to UW, and as a model for other campuses, but also cities and regions. This project creates an opportunity for students to lead a project that develops and studies smart solar energy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.",
