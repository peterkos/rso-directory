In association with the national organization, Active Minds, we strive to promote mental health awareness and education through campaigns, fundraising, informational meetings, and community-wide events. Examples of such campaigns and events include: Stress Less Week, Suicide Prevention Month, National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, etc.. Mental health disorders are an ever-growing problem in college. Unfortunately, most students suffer silently for fear of what others may think, or they simply don�t know where to start in getting help. It can be horribly isolating. Our goal is to provide a place where students can learn about mental health, and mental health issues. We hope to provide information about resources both on and off campus in order to promote help-seeking behaviors in individuals who may be able to benefit from them. We also work to relay the latest scholarly findings of mental health research and information as it pertains to college students. Mental health affects everyone in one way or another, which is why we need to bring Active Mind to UW. All students are welcome and encouraged to join. Please be sure to keep in mind that this is NOT a support group, and we do not provide any mental health counseling of any kind. We are not mental health professionals, but rather students interested in spreading mental health information and awareness, in order to stand up against the stigma surrounding mental health problems, and to promote a mentally healthy campus. Students with or without mental health issues are equally encouraged to join.",

Together, we can bring that number to zero.\n\nBeyond the Bomb is a bold new step towards a world free of the nuclear system�s yoke. Through grassroots organizing all over the U.S., we will build a wave of opposition to nuclear weapons and the networks of money and power that prop them up. Our movement will move from the local level to the state level to the federal level, building a base of engaged activists and supporters to change the conversation around nuclear weapons in this country. We are embracing the intersectionality of our issue, basing our organization on the knowledge that it�s the most marginalized of communities that are affected most by the nuclear system. Basing our organizing and actions around the voices of those communities and lifting up their stories, we will reveal the true fruits of the corrupt nuclear status quo.",

However, this is not the case for most premedical students. While there are many avenues for students to become involved in research, there are few, if any for premedical students research experience in the medical field. \n\nThe purpose of this organization is to increase awareness amongst undergraduates about the availability of clinical research, to serve as a student-run clinical research advising center, but most importantly to connect these students to University of Washington Medical Center medical providers that are willing to consider undergraduate help for their ongoing or planned research projects. Our secondary purpose is promote the University of Washington as a research institution by helping these undergraduate students present their work at regional and national conferences.",
